	MAXv
==============================================================================

Synopsis
--------

Since the motor record device driver for the MAXv queries the MAXv for it's
configuration before there is a connection between the record and the device,
IOC's that use MAXv's must be initially booted in order for the MAXv to be
configured, and then rebooted before the motor record can read the correct
configuration.


For all MAXv motors.
--------------------

Configure the MAXv's limit switch sense by placing one of the following MAXv
controller commands in the INIT field.  This command determines which TTL
signal level defines an active limit switch input:

LL; - low (default).
LH; - high.

Note: Separate multiple commands in the INIT field with ";".


Configuring the MAXv for an open loop stepper motor (default).
--------------------------------------------------------------
Set J8 for stepper and add the command "PS0;" to the INIT field.


Configuring the MAXv for a stepper motor with encoder.
------------------------------------------------------
Set J8 for stepper and add the command "PSE;" to the INIT field.


Configuring the MAXv for a servo motor.
---------------------------------------
Set J8 for servo and add the command "PSM;" to the INIT field.


!!WARNING!! READ ALL OF THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH!

After all the MAXv controller commands have been configured for all the axes
in one individual MAXv, add the "APP" command to the end of the last axes
INIT field.  The "APP" command instructs the MAXv controller to store a set of
the current parameters as the power-up default values in FLASH memory.  Repeat
the above for all the MAXv controllers and corresponding records.  Boot the
IOC.  The limit switch sense and motor type are now stored in the MAXv's flash
memory.  REMOVE the "APP" commands from ALL the MAXv motor record INIT fields.
Reboot the IOC. The motor record should now have the correct configuration.
