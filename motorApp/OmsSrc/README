	MAXv
==============================================================================

Synopsis
--------

Since the motor record device driver for the MAXv queries the MAXv for it's
configuration before there is a connection between the record and the device,
IOC's that use MAXv's must be initially booted in order for the MAXv to be
configured, and then rebooted before the motor record can read the correct
configuration.


For all MAXv motors.
--------------------

Configure the MAXv's limit switch sense by placing one of the following MAXv
controller commands in the 2nd argument of MAXvConfig(); the initialization
string.  This command determines which TTL signal level defines an active
limit switch input:

LL - low (default).
LH - high.

In addition, the one of the following MAXv controller commands must appear in 
the 2nd argument of MAXvConfig() to configure the type of axis:
PSO - open loop stepper axis.
PSE - stepper axis with encoder.
PSM - servo axis

Note: Separate multiple commands in the initialization string with ";".


Configuring the MAXv for an open loop stepper motor (default).
--------------------------------------------------------------
Set J8 for stepper and add the command "PS0;" to the INIT field.


Configuring the MAXv for a stepper motor with encoder.
------------------------------------------------------
Set J8 for stepper and add the command "PSE;" to the INIT field.


Configuring the MAXv for a servo motor.
---------------------------------------
Set J8 for servo and add the command "PSM;" to the INIT field.


!!WARNING!! READ ALL OF THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH!

After all the MAXv controller commands have been configured for all the axes
in one individual MAXv, add the "APP" command to the end of the last axes
INIT field.  The "APP" command instructs the MAXv controller to store a set of
the current parameters as the power-up default values in FLASH memory.  Repeat
the above for all the MAXv controllers and corresponding records.  Boot the
IOC.  The limit switch sense and motor type are now stored in the MAXv's flash
memory.  REMOVE the "APP" commands from ALL the MAXv motor record INIT fields.
Reboot the IOC. The motor record should now have the correct configuration.

VMEbus addressing
-----------------

MAXv array base address - defined the by 3rd argument to the MAXvSetup() call.
MAXv incremental address - increment each additional MAXv's VMEbus address by
				0x1000 from the array base address.


VME8, VME44, VS4, VX2
==============================================================================

OMS array base address - defined the by 3rd argument to the omsSetup() call.
                       - the VMEbus address of the 1st board in the array of
		         OMS boards.
OMS incremental address - increment each additional board's VMEbus address by
				0x10 from the array base address.

IMPORTANT NOTES
---------------

1. The EPICS motor record does NOT support the encoder mode.  The encoder mode
	is enabled with the ER#,# and results in all distance, velocity and
	acceleration parameters being input in encoder counts.


SSCAN THROUGH-PUT NOTES
