To run this Newport MM4000/5, "asyn" example on a Unix OS;

in <motor>/Makefile: the following two lines must be uncommented;
	#DIRS := $(DIRS) $(filter-out $(DIRS), motorExApp)
	#DIRS := $(DIRS) $(filter-out $(DIRS), iocBoot)

in <motor>/configure/RELEASE: ASYN= must be defined.

in <motor>/motorApp/Makefile: #DIRS += NewportSrc must be uncommented.

in <motor>/motorExApp/Makefile: #DIRS += WithMPF must be uncommented.

Finally, cd <motor>; gnumake clean uninstall; gnumake

Assuming the EPICS_HOST_ARCH environment variable is set correctly,
start the ioc from this directory by executing the following command.

../../bin/${EPICS_HOST_ARCH}/WithMPF st.cmd.sun
OR,
../../bin/${EPICS_HOST_ARCH}/WithMPF st.cmd.linux
